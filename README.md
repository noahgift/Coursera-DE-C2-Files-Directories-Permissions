### Part 1: Find Python code

1.  There are three python scripts, find them using the `find` command:  ` find -name "*.py"`
2.  How many did you find and where are they located?

### Part 2: Run Python code by using chmod

1.  Now run one of them as a script using this syntax:  `./one.py`
2.  What went wrong?
3.  Change the file to be executable using the following chmod command:  `chmod +x one.py`
4.  Run it again.  Did it work?  Why?

### Part 3: Run Python code by using chmod recursively

1.  Change all Python code to be executable recursively using the following command:  `chmod -R -x *.py`
